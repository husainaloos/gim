things I want to support

// to be remotely useful
- [x] typing txt
- [x] opening file
- [x] arrow navigation (up and down, left and write) ignoring wrapping
- [x] backspace support
- [] enter support
- [] implement arrow to consodier wrapping (right and left)
- [] save file support (ctrl-s for now)
  to support this, I will need to start creating the structure of the file
  it appears that it is easy to think of a file as a list of line. most source codes
  are stuctured that way anyway. and this is the pattern used in micro and neovim. However
  neovim uses a tree structure, which is more optimized, yet more complex. I think I can start
  with line array view (similar to micro) and see if I really need a more complex view.
- [] support for insert and normal mode (enter insert mode with i)
- [] indication that it is insert mode (status at the bottom)
